# Pokédex Explorer

An unofficial, modern, production-grade web application combining an encyclopedic Pokédex with seven interactive Pokémon mini-games. Powered by the public [PokéAPI v2](https://pokeapi.co/), built with Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript (strict mode), and Tailwind CSS.

## ⚡ Highlights

- **Complete Pokédex Explorer:** Real-time search by name or Pokédex number, filtering by Pokémon type (all 18 types) and generation (Generations I–IX) using exact API intersection logic.
- **Detailed Pokémon Profiles:** Official artwork, shiny variant toggle, base stats with proportional visual gauges, physical dimensions, abilities, flavor text, and audio cries.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Compare any two Pokémon across all base stats with real-time stat advantage highlighting.
- **Temporary Favorites & Team Builder:** Bookmark favorites and assemble a 6-member squad with automated combined type defense & vulnerability analysis.
- **7 Fully Playable Mini-Games:**
  1. **Who's That Pokémon?** — Fast-paced 10-round multiple-choice visual quiz.
  2. **Silhouette Challenge** — Pure silhouette shape recognition without revealing spoilers.
  3. **Higher or Lower** — Guess whether the next Pokémon's base stat is higher or lower with strictly enforced tie-breakers.
  4. **Pokémon Cry Quiz** — Listen to official sound cries and identify the Pokémon.
  5. **Type Match** — Test your mastery of single and dual-type elemental multipliers.
  6. **Memory Card Game** — Interactive card flipping with move counts and timer.
  7. **Battle Simulator** — Turn-based tactical combat simulator featuring Quick Attack, Power Attack, and Defend mechanics against an AI opponent.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Instant runtime bilingual interface switching between **English (en)** and **Thai (th)** with no page reload required.
- **Strict Ephemeral Privacy:** 100% session-based state; zero cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, or tracking databases used.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Temporary Session Storage:** By design, all bookmarked favorites, teams, and game high scores reside in runtime React Context and reset upon browser page reload.
- **Simplified Battle Simulator:** The battle simulator is an educational game using derived base stats, action priority, and elemental multiplier interactions. It does not reproduce official competitive tournament rules (EVs/IVs, items, abilities, weather, or entry hazards).
- **PokéAPI Public Service:** Image artwork and sound cries rely on PokéAPI's public endpoints; offline use requires previously cached network assets.
